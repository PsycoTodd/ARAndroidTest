===============
This is a 2 day quick project to show my understanding of AR and computer gracphis. 
A lot of challengs includes:
1. To set up a NDK based opengl rendering pipeline.
2. Include GLM matrix library.
3. Include OpenCV3.0 for Android device.
4. Implement the VBO based mesh rendering (bug exists for texture UV.)
5. Use opencv ORB feature extractor to find feature and resolve the transformation.

The project will run on devices with ABI armeabi-v7a.

The project is set up based on:
